    <h1>Who is Shaun Hailey?</h1>
    <p>
      Shaun is a graduate of the final cohort from the St. Petersburg, FL campus of The Iron Yard. He has resided in
      Tampa, FL since 2003. Enamored with the rewards of learning, he left the mortgage lending world after over a
      decade in the industry as a mortgage underwriting manager. With a comprehensive education spanning HTML, CSS, SQL,
      JavaScript, NodeJS, and with specialization in ReactJS, he is prepared to continue the expansion of his skills as
      a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaun is passionate about music and has acted as the Sound Designer for several theatrical productions in Tampa.
      He spends far too much time noodling around in Ableton, Wavelab, and other noisemaking goodies. An avid collector
      of music in all genre, he is always seeking new hard drives to store his collection. He can play any brass
      instrument with valves, and is pretty terrible on keyboards, harmonica and digeridoo. Shaun is also religiously
      devoted to Formula One racing and loves to tend to his garden.
